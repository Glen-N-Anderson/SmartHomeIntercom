	Reference: Notes from meeting with Kevin (see email)
	
	BATMAN is written in C, will probably use C for network part of project
	Python could be useful for other aspects/features of the system that don't need to be super fast 
	
	
	Notes:
		
		-Same time all term, could carry over to future terms if we want
		-Usually meet at Kelley 2098
		-~6 months of development, this will have to be done before Spring term
		-Should try to build a good relationship with the client, part of grade will come from how happy he is with project 
		-5% per day late penalty for assignments 
		-Test cases for metrics or time cases for users to perform a task 
		-Don't reinvent the wheel, use existing toolsets and talk to client about them 
		
	Reccomendations:
		
		-Learn about ad-hoc networks
		-Learn about video encryption, possible libraries
		-Document what we do thoroughly 
		-Talk to client about progress, discrepencies between description and implementation and changing implementation/functionality 
		-Organize requirements and ask Kevin for details as to why these requirements exist
