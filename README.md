# SmartHomeIntercom
Smart Home Intercom project for CS461 - Senior Capstone

A home intercom system allows individuals to communicate with each other between rooms. This system can be made more intelligent by adding cameras, microphones, and functionality that allows users to specify rooms to ring and know where other users are located. Such a system needs to be designed securely as if it was compromised it could leak personal data such as video and audio. To prevent this, a secure design will have to be implemented that will prevent the intercom devices from communicating with the outside world.

This system will be implemented with Raspberry Pi 3s as they allow for enough processing power to run the system but are also compact, which will keep the system usable and out of the way. The system will be wall mounted and powered through a wall socket.
